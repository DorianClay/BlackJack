# BlackJack
A project to practice the SOLID OOP Design Principles.

## Gameplay

1. You are dealt 2 cards.
2. You have the choice to hit or stay.
3. If you hit, you are dealt another card.
4. If your point value is over 21, you bust and lose.
5. If your point value is 21 or less, repeat step 2.
6. If you stay, the dealer hits until they are over 16.
7. Highest point value under 22 wins. Player wins ties.

## SOLID Principles

### S: Single Responsibility Principle

The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) states that any class must have one, and only one, reason to change. If a class has more than one reason to change, it should be refactored (larger, structural editing).

The motivation is to minimize changes we will have to make, when inevitably requirements change.
